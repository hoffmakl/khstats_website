&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A personal narrative about my experience on the data analytics side of NYC’s COVID-19 outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 15, 2018.&lt;/strong&gt; My coworker is moving to California. She’s a statistician for a group of pulmonary and critical care physicians at our New York City hospital, and I’m a statistician who’s trying not to do too many things wrong, only three months into my first job out of school. “I think you’d be good with this research team,” she tells me. “There’s some really interesting studies on lung diseases.” I nod, because that’s what you do when you’ve been at your job for three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take over her projects and start learning organ failure scoring systems, signs of septic shock, and the differences between invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation. My close friend does cutting-edge cancer statistics, and I feel a bit resentful. Nobody ever wants to hear about the controversial definitions of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome at family parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the months pass by I slowly build my mental encyclopedia and begin to embrace my role as a pulmonary and critical care team’s biostatistician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 5th, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; A full year and three months later, I wake up very sick. It is the kind of sick where you can’t do anything but curl up on your bathroom floor and let &lt;em&gt;being sick&lt;/em&gt; consume you. Too sick to read, too sick to sleep. I spike a fever and can hardly move for two days before I hobble to the doctor’s office and nearly faint mid-exam. The doctor insists I stay until I drink an entire bottle of water. “Is there anyone to check on you at home?” he asks, concerned. No, no, I’ll be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the week my fever breaks and I’m back to work. It’s early March, so “Coronavirus?!” is everyone’s first question. They’re all joking, except the pulmonologists I work with. Nothing respiratory, I assure them. One isn’t convinced. “Some young people are getting ‘silent hypoxia.’ It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to have Covid-19 with no respiratory symptoms at all,” she tells me. Months later, I’ll read that as the headline of various news articles, but the time, no testing is available to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 17, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; Barely two weeks pass before the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases explode in New York City. Restaurants are instructed to close the day before Saint Patrick’s Day, my birthday. I can’t meet up with my friends anymore, so I cook Annie’s mac and cheese and run to Central Park to watch the sun set behind skyscrapers. My grandparents call me and they make &lt;em&gt;Happy Birthday&lt;/em&gt; sound like a hymn from a Catholic mass and I laugh, and it is the only part of my day that feels like every other birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m leaving the park, my mom texts me that she hopes I had a good day. Any other year it would be strange for her to nearly miss my birthday, but this year she is working long hours. She’s a nursing director back in Michigan and her hospital is already preparing for their own impending COVID-19 outbreak. The preparations will not be in vain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I jog home, I spot a digital sign asking former healthcare workers to volunteer to take care of NYC COVID-19 patients. Before I began my career in biostatistics, I worked at a hospital caring for acutely ill patients, so I sign up without hesitation. My misguided logic is that the exploding numbers of COVID-19 cases will make my critical care collaborators too busy to pursue their research, and this seems like the best way for me to help as the world descends into chaos. While I fill out the online contact form, I wonder what it will feel like to take care of patients again. I look up YouTube videos to refresh myself on fastening gait belts and inserting IVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How absolutely crazy that I thought my biostatistics training wouldn’t be useful, in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 22, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a pulmonary and critical care team’s statistician so &lt;em&gt;naturally&lt;/em&gt; I am one of the first analysts at my hospital pulled into COVID-19 work. It starts with a text on a Sunday – the first of many – from a pulmonologist. “Do we have a data dictionary for our ICU database, Kat?” We do have a data dictionary, but the translations of critical care jargon relevant to other analysts live undocumented in my brain. Within days, I am told to drop all of my other research projects for COVID-19 work. Our informatics team is using the structure of the ICU database I work with as part of a COVID-19 tracking repository for our entire hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first request for me is straightforward: summarize the laboratory results from our first 300 COVID-19 patients. 300 patients at our hospital! How terrifying, I think to myself. It seems only a week ago the news reports said there were 300 people in the entire city with COVID-19. I begin working through issues linking the databases, identifying missing information, and explaining variables to other new COVID-19 analysts. Each morning I pull new data and watch the files grow exponentially larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless questions flooding in from all over the hospital. Most of them revolve around “who will get intubated, and when?” My hospital, like so many other hospitals in NYC, is on track to run out of ventilators soon. My attendance becomes mandatory at multiple “risk prediction” meetings each week. I find myself in charge of extensive data cleaning and then writing code for models to answer vague and terrifying questions: we need to figure out which patients will “crash,” who can be transferred, and, if we run out of ventilators, who has the best chance to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a junior researcher, previously unconcerned with hospital operations, suddenly confronted with the task of providing rapid answers for potentially immediate decision making. I accept my new role with the utmost seriousness. My days, normally spent quietly coding with my double monitors at a big desk, suddenly fill up with Zoom meetings from 8:30-5:00 from a laptop at my kitchen table. Each night after the meetings end, I take advantage of the relative calm to code into the early hours of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several weeks I use the long, uninterrupted hours of weekends to work, waking up with the sun and continuing on until at least 11pm, with few breaks in between. On some nights I send my mom “good morning” texts at 5am. “Are you waking up early or have you not slept yet?” is always her first question. The next is, “No fever? No cough?” She is worried about me, living in the international epicenter, but I’m just as worried about her, working at a hospital every day. She informs me that my dad is sleeping in my old bedroom in case she brings the virus home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 4, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; My best friend and her sister are also nurses in Michigan. I FaceTime her to check in. She and her sister’s units have become “hot floors”; every room is filled with a COVID-19 patient. They were living with their parents, another sister, uncle, and cousins, but both have moved to an AirBnb for the foreseeable future. “It’s so crazy here, Kitty,” she tells me in a defeated voice. At the time, Michigan’s rate of infection is second only to New York’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of her nursing friends has been hospitalized with COVID-19 and is on 6 Liters of oxygen. I can’t help but think about the prediction models I’ve been working on. I mentally run his characteristics through them. I know what my models would estimate his probability of intubation to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listen to her talk about the N-95 masks they’ve been given. “Remember how they used to say those were one-time use?” she asks me. I do. “They started telling us they were good for the whole day, and then they said they’d be good for the whole week, and now they’re saying we might have to start sharing.” I wonder what data analyst, perhaps just like me, is crunching those numbers and feeding the information to hospital administration. “The virus is so terrible. I’ve never done so much post-mortem care, zipped so many body bags…” Her voice drifts off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel guilty, on the sidelines. I see the raccoon eyes – the only part of their faces visible between hair caps and procedure masks – of the physicians I spend all day hopping on and off meetings with, and I desperately want to help. I cannot hold the hand of a patient with COVID-19 but I have all their data at my keystrokes: millions of lab results, vital signs, and procedure codes. I see their inflammatory cytokines spike, I watch their oxygen levels plummet, I can tell you which organs are failing, who’s on which experimental drug, and who’s just been made Do Not Intubate and Do Not Resuscitate. I follow in horror, almost in real-time, the time-stamps of admission, intubation, death. I cannot compare this experience to physically caring for COVID-19 patients, but I feel haunted by it all the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hole up in my tiny studio in Manhattan for days at a time, listening to the wails of ambulances and pings of messages from my computer. I see only one friend with any frequency; we both live alone, 18 blocks from each other. She texts me often, asking me to meet her in Central Park. She suspects I am not doing well, and she is right. I walk with her all over the Upper East Side a few times a week, each of us donned in our black cotton masks. We try not to talk about COVID, but it’s hard to avoid when our walks take us past the pop-up ICU tents and refrigerated trucks that stretch entire blocks – the overflow morgues for NYC’s dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We try to time our walks so that we’re outside at 7pm, when the city unites to cheer for healthcare workers. If I’m not out walking with her, I climb religiously onto my fire escape every night to clap. Sometimes a man in the apartment across the street sings Sinatra. &lt;em&gt;I want to wake up in the city that never sleeps… New York, New York!&lt;/em&gt; I’ve only lived here two years, but I miss “the city that never sleeps” so badly that it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life continues in this way for me, with no real sense of time or distinguishing events, from mid March until early May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 10, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; It is Mother’s Day, and my 50th straight day of working with COVID data. At 11pm, my cell phone goes off. It is an ominous vibration against my kitchen table, where I am perpetually sitting with my laptop whirring. “Hi Honey… I just wanted to let you know that, mmm…” it’s my mom, and her voice is cracking. I finish the sentence for her, “Aunt Peggy died?” I ask, sadly. “Yes.” “Okay. Thanks for letting me know.” I stare into the white brick wall in front of my kitchen table for so long that I start seeing multicolored spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandfather’s eldest sister, my Aunt Peggy, had begun showing telltale symptoms of COVID and tested positive only a few days previously. She’d been without any visitors in her assisted living home for months due to isolation restrictions. She was royalty in our family; the red-lipsticked, always fashionably late, prized guest at every family party. She had an unforgettable, incredibly sweet voice, and I can still hear her words to me last Christmas. “How’s New York, Katherine? I’m so proud of you.” She was the first nurse in my family, and she influenced my mom to become a nurse, who influenced me to pursue medical research. The matriarch of our family left us on Mother’s Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend the night trying to find a rental car company that will allow me to drive one-way from New York to Michigan. It can’t be done; I am several weeks too late in my exodus from the city. I book a flight instead and leave a few days later on a near-empty plane to spend time with my family. I plan to stay in Michigan for two weeks, but I don’t leave for two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September 20, 2020.&lt;/strong&gt; The leaves I watched bud in Central Park during my walks this spring are changing to red and gold. As I write this, I think of countless other ways I could attempt to explain what my tiny corner of the world was like during NYC’s outbreak. Most are too personal to ever record. At the same time, it is difficult to share even the memories I have already written, because I know they are incomparable to the frontline workers’ who risked their lives everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experiences living and working in Manhattan during March, April, and May will stick with me forever. I hope there comes a day that I can meet in real life – mask free – all the analysts, hospital administrators, physicians, residents, fellows, medical students, and data engineers I conversed with so frequently during the height of the outbreak. I hope we never have to repeat those conversations. It is a wish that I fear will not come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this past week I attended a meeting with our Informatics team. “It’s good to ‘see’ everyone again,” someone said. It was only half accurate – the circumstances that bring us to meetings together are never good. We discussed data structures for a possible second wave of COVID-19 in NYC as schools and indoor dining reopen. After the call, I felt an immense sadness, despite being in a much better place than when I left the city in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of my heart, I don’t know if I can handle another round of it all. Can you?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stats on Drugs: An Interview with a Pharmaceutical CRO Biostatistician</title>
      <link>/blog/ditl/pharma-cro/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/kim1.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I wrote my first blog post, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.khstats.com/blog/ditl-biostats/&#34;&gt;“A Day in the Life of a Biostatistician,”&lt;/a&gt; documenting the granular details of my work as an early career academic research biostatistician. I’m excited to announce I am turning that post into a “day in the life” series in which I interview other biostatisticians with differing roles. My hope is that it will enlighten anyone interested in the field of biostatistics, and especially help undergraduate and current biostatistics Masters students make informed decisions about their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first interviewee is Kim Hirschhorn, a former classmate and good friend from my time at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. Kim is an avid reality TV show watcher, loves Eggo waffles and Hostess Ho-Hos, and is a great statistician; so great, professors were often confused as to why she wasn’t planning to pursue a PhD. Kim, however, has always been adamant that she doesn’t need a PhD to have the career she wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim’s determination to find a job which allowed for ample career growth with “only” an MS in Biostatistics paid off. After graduating in 2018, she chose to work as a biostatistician at PRA Health Sciences, a Contract Research Organization (CRO) for pharmaceutical companies. Biostatistician roles at CROs offer excellent career trajectory for Masters-level statisticians and don’t have a job title ceiling as some careers in statistics notoriously do for those without a PhD. Additionally, it’s a lucrative job option for a Masters-level biostatistician. (🤑!) For more information on salaries of early career statisticians you can check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2019/08/01/mastergraduate/&#34;&gt;American Statistical Association’s recent survey of 2018 Masters in Statistics graduates&lt;/a&gt;. But, to learn more about what Kim actually does as a biostatistician at a pharmaceutical CRO, read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kat: Thanks for taking the time to chat, Kim! Can you tell me where you work and what the mission of your company is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kim: I work at the Chicago office of a large CRO called PRA Health Sciences. PRA stands for Pharmaceutical Research Associates, and our primary responsibility is to run clinical trials for pharmaceutical companies. This includes everything from planning the study at an administrative level – such as identifying physicians to recruit patients and administer drug therapies – to collecting data like patients’ disease progression and adverse events, analyzing and summarizing the results, and submitting requests for the successful trials to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). After a pharmaceutical company has researched and developed a potential new drug, we partner with them to implement the various phases of clinical trials necessary to test that drug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whoa, sometimes I forget about all the steps in a clinical trial. Before we go any further, can you give us a quick explanation about what those phases of clinical trials mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are three main phases: Phase I, II, and III. In general, Phase I clinical trials check whether a drug is safe to administer. Sometimes this also involves testing which dosage of a drug is safe – or at least not overwhelmingly toxic – to the body. Phase I trials are usually done on a small group of patients. Phase II trials are done on a larger group of patients and focus on whether the drug is effective, or in other words, whether it can actually fix whatever health problem the pharmaceutical company had in mind when developing it. Most drugs fail in Phase II.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If a drug does move onto a Phase III trial, its performance in comparison to the current standard of care (which is often another drug on the market) is evaluated. In both Phase II and III, patients are randomized into treatment and control groups and typically neither physicians nor patients know which treatment is administered. Even patients who are not receiving a treatment will receive a sugar pill, or placebo drug. Oftentimes a clinical trial’s aims will fall somewhere between two phases. For example, I’ve worked on Phase 1b/2a trials that collect information on safety, determine the recommended dose, and then evaluate the drug’s efficacy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see, so which of those phases do you work on?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have been a Biostatistician I for a bit over a year now, so that means I am the lead biostatistician on a few simple Phase I trials. There is usually not much statistical testing occurring here; it’s all about how many patients have an adverse response to the drug. Since I am still in the most junior biostatistician role, a lot of my time is spent doing biostatistical support for Phase II and III trials, where more senior biostatisticians oversee my work and pre-specify the analyses. The longer I stay at my job, the more responsibilities I will have and the more complex studies I will lead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s involved in leading a study, even a “small and simple” phase I? How is that different from the work you do as “biostatistical support” on the Phase II and III trials?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I am the lead of a study, I am meeting with members of the pharmaceutical company and working with them to develop a statistical analysis plan. Once the clinical trial starts and I begin to receive data, I work with programmers to ensure everything that needs to be done for the analysis is completed in the time allotted by that trial’s budget. Since the studies I am leading now are early phase, I am in charge of doing all the statistical analyses and reporting the results back to the pharmaceutical company. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In contrast, when I am biostatistical support, I am mostly executing analyses already specified in a statistical analysis plan. This typically involves writing macros in the statistical programming language &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/stat.html&#34;&gt;SAS&lt;/a&gt; to ultimately produce what is dozens of outputs. A large portion of my time as a junior biostatistician is spent figuring out the best way to present that huge amount of data and results in a comprehensible way. Even before I have data from a clinical trial, I have to plan out detailed tables and prepare a shell document for when the data is ready for analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are you working with in your day-to-day roles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I get assignments from my manager, and then work with the lead biostatisticians on each trial. It is standard in the pharmaceutical industry that all analyses must be independently reproduced. This usually means the lead biostatistician is redoing my analysis without looking at my code, so sometimes I have to work closely with him or her to figure out why our results are not matching. Besides that, I frequently collaborate with the data programmers and statistical programmers in charge of the data for the trials I am working on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data programmers are in charge of taking raw data from the trials, checking it for inconsistencies, and putting it into a standardized form for statistical programmers. Statistical programmers then take those standardized data sets, derive many new variables from those initially collected for each patient, and produce hundreds of tables and figures summarizing the data. In some cases they also help prepare the data for my analyses, for example, they might write code to calculate the number of days or months until each patient experienced disease progression so that I can use that information for statistical models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If there is a problem with the data when I am running a model, I ask the statistical programmer to check his or her code, and if there is no issue there, the data programmer looks at their code. If necessary, the data programmer may go back to the clinical sites who are collecting the data from patients and ask them to correct any missing information or inconsistencies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds like your data is in pretty good shape when it arrives to you, then!
Earlier you mentioned writing macros in SAS. Does everyone use SAS? Could you use R or another programming language if you wanted?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have used R for a few side analyses, such as a data mining analysis. However, the industry standard for pharmaceuticals has always been SAS. I don’t foresee that changing anytime soon. Although a huge benefit of R is that it is free and open source software, meaning anyone can contribute code in a package, SAS has the advantage that if you run a certain type of statistical model, you can be absolutely sure that is what ran on your data. Because SAS is a paid software, it is liable for what it says it is doing, and there is always support on hand if you have questions about errors or results you are getting from any given data procedure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your hours like? What sort of flexibility do you have for vacation, or working remotely?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I usually get in at 8:15 and leave somewhere between 4:45 and 5:15. I do get a lot of vacation days, with the caveat that if there is a deliverable deadline for a project I’m working on, I may not be able to take my vacation during that time. As for working remotely, it’s an option I have as-needed, such as if I have a doctor’s appointment. The job can definitely be done 100% remotely, and in fact many members of the company work remotely, but it’s not really an option for a Biostatistician I to do all the time because we rely so heavily on our senior biostatisticians. I prefer that, though - it’s easier for me to work in the office!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will your roles and responsibilities change as you progress as a biostatistician at a CRO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I said a lot of my time is spent working on table shells and report planning, I think it’s worth acknowledging that that is not a very exciting activity. However, as a Biostatistician I progresses to Biostatistician II, Senior Biostatistician, Principal Biostatistician, Senior Principal Biostatistician, etc., a lot of those more mundane (in my opinion) tasks decrease. You are in charge of much more complex studies and specifying the statistical analyses for that clinical trial. The work also naturally becomes more managerial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Being in charge of a trial means meeting with both external clients and internal company leadership, setting timelines for data/statistical programmers and junior biostatisticians, answering questions that come up about data and analyses, maintaining oversight of the hours each team member is spending on the project, and tracking the corresponding budget carefully. As biostatisticians progress in the career ladder at a CRO, they have some flexibility in how much data they actually analyze on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you decide to take this position at a CRO over your other offers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well of course it’s not all about money, but this was one of the highest offers I received, so that helped. The potential for career growth was also very appealing to me. Typically after about 4-5 years you are a Senior Biostatistician and qualified to lead any study. But, you can lead studies long before this if the pharmaceutical company agrees you are qualified to do so. I really like that career progression at a pharmaceutical CRO is very much about experience and skills, as opposed to whether or not you hold a PhD. This is often not the case if you work directly for a pharmaceutical company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, what made you choose to enter the field of Biostatistics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have always been drawn to a career in public health. During my first year at the University of Illinois, I was a stereotypical freshman pre-med student. I ultimately changed my mind about medical school and got a Bachelor’s degree in statistics, but I still took several epidemiology and biology classes just because I found them interesting. Math has always been my strongest subject, but I wanted to find a way to combine it with my other interests. After doing a fair share of Googling, I found the field of Biostatistics. I met with the head of U of I’s Statistics MS program, and he shared his experience of working in industry as a biostatistician before becoming a professor. He spoke very highly of the field and gave me a lot of great information on the types of careers I could have with a Masters in Statistics or Biostatistics. I was pretty much sold after that meeting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking back, are you happy with your decision to do a Masters in Biostatistics, rather than Statistics or Applied Statistics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, I’m really happy I decided on a Masters in Biostatistics. Throughout my program, our applied problem sets were always related to medicine or healthcare in some way, and it was easy for me to take health-specific statistics classes, such as a clinical trials methodology course. Since I was pretty sure I wanted to go into healthcare, I think biostatistics was a great decision for me, because a Masters in Biostatistics shows my passion for the field and may give me an edge over similar applicants who have a more general Masters in Statistics or Applied Statistics. I still find public health to be the most interesting sector to practice statistics in, so I think the degree will always be to my advantage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks so much for chatting, Kim!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have other questions for Kim, or if there are careers within biostatistics you’d like to hear about, feel free to email me and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kat&lt;/p&gt;
