<p>Are you an applied statistician? Are you trying to be a <em>better</em> applied statistician and implement causal inference methods like propensity scores but you’re overwhelmed and don’t know where to start?! Do you have an analysis due Friday and you’re stressin’ about what <code>R</code> package will help you implement previously mentioned methods ASAP?!?!</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/rD5gxLqzUrAha/giphy.gif" /></p>
<p>A recent past-self of mine would’ve replied yes, yes, yes. However, I have spent the past year learning and implementing causal inference methods as a research biostatistician at a medical university, and I’m excited to share my favorite method, TMLE. I’ve tried to explain at the minimum level I think is necessary for an applied statistician to implement it in hopes that others will feel empowered to try it out.</p>
<p><em>A warning:</em> There is no math in this post… 😇 If you want to learn about the math behind TMLE, I recommend the paper <a href="https://biostats.bepress.com/ucbbiostat/paper252/">“A Gentle Introduction”</a> by Susan Gruber and Mark van der Laan, or for a deeper dive, the book <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9782-1">“Targeted Learning”</a> by van der Laan and Sherri Rose. For broader introductions to causal inference, I like both Judea Pearl’s <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/PRIMER/">“Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer”</a> and Miguel Hernan and James Robins’ <a href="https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1268/2019/11/ci_hernanrobins_10nov19.pdf">“Causal Inference: What If”</a> books.</p>
<p><strong>This article is solely meant to help someone understand TMLE on a conceptual or applied level, and then implement it in R for a statistical analysis.</strong> Before I give a motivation for TMLE, a quick refresher on causal inference and propensity scores:</p>
<p><em>Causal inference</em> refers to the many tools available to us to help answer questions like “what would have happened if we had done <em>this</em> instead of <em>that</em>?” To truly answer these questions, we’d need to rewind time to see what would have happened if we’d done something differently. In a world without Time-Turners, our next best option is to set up an experiment where individuals randomly get <em>this</em> exposure, or <em>that</em> exposure, and then look at the differences in what happened to the two groups. In industry research, that’s called A/B testing, and in medical research, it’s a randomized control trial.</p>
<p>Due to practicality and ethics, this sort of experiment is not always possible. Sometimes our only option is to use the data we already have, which records what happened under various exposures that were not randomized. As statisticians, we know there’s a lot of bias in observational data like this, because individuals received (or even chose) their exposure for a myriad of reasons. We try to control for the factors that affected an individual’s exposure and outcome by adjusting for confounders in our regression model. The issue with a model like linear regression is that it is Insert Issues Here.</p>
<p><strong>Propensity scores are one of the first ways statisticians came up with to help answer the <em>this</em> vs. <em>that</em> question using observational data.</strong> The idea of propensity scores is to use an estimator – often as simple as a logistic regression model – to get a probability estimate, or “score,” which represents an individual’s likelihood of receiving an exposure given their baseline covariates. We then use that score in some way to try to reduce bias in our calculation of the exposure effect.</p>
<p><strong>In medicine, the intuitive understanding of propensity scores is that we want to make the estimates from our observational data closer to what they would be if they came from data on a perfectly executed randomized clinical trial.</strong></p>
<p>A few common ways of using a propensity score, or probability estimate, that you may have heard of before:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Matching:</strong> run your analysis on a subgroup of individuals in which every person who received the exposure has a “matching” person with a similar propensity score, but who did not receive the exposure. In a simple example of matching, if you have 500 people who received the exposure and 1000 who did not, you will find the 500 people who did not receive the exposure but who had propensity scores based on their baseline covariates who were closest to those that did, and then run your analysis on that subgroup of the population.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW):</strong> uses the propensity score to down-weight patients who did receive the exposure, or treatment, and had a high probability of receiving the exposure and upweighting patients who did not receive the exposure but had a high probability of receiving the exposure given their baseline covariates.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If we think a bit about the first option, matching, it should become obvious that by taking a subgroup of our population in this way, we are making our estimates of the exposure effect extremely prone to bias. IPTW is usually the better option of the two, and if you’d like to read a good blog post on understanding IPTW better with examples in R, I recommend Lucy Mcgowan’s blog post <a href="https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2019/01/17/understanding-propensity-score-weighting/">“Understanding Propensity Score Weighting.”</a></p>
<p>However, there’s actually another four letter acronym out there that far fewer statisticians have heard about: <strong>TMLE</strong></p>
<p>TMLE aims to solve the same issue of imbalanced exposures as other propensity score methods. The most basic form of TMLE is analogous to the previous examples I gave for matching and IPTW: we have an exposure and outcome that is affected by confounders, and we’re trying to estimate the average difference in outcome if we were to switch the exposure from <em>this</em> to <em>that</em> for all individuals.</p>
<p>This basic form of the TMLE algorithm uses two estimates:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>the probability an individual receives an exposure of interest, given their baseline confounders (their propensity score)</p></li>
<li><p>the probability an individual experiences an outcome of interest, given their exposure and baseline confounders</p></li>
</ol>
<p>and uses those probability estimates to estimate the average difference in outcomes if everyone were to have received the exposure, compared to if everyone were to not have received the exposure.</p>
<p>The actual algorithm to estimate this probability is quite complex, but is similar to the iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in maximum likelihood estimation. The wonderful news is that you don’t need to know the algorithm as an applied statistician who wants to implement TMLE! However, it’s very interesting, and if you’d like to understand more, you should read the aforementioned references.</p>
<p>So, why do I think TMLE is better than IPTW or other propensity score matching methods? In short, because you don’t need to fit any certain type of regression to get those probability estimates. You can use any estimator you want – a generalized linear model, splines, random forests, gradient boosting, neural nets, honestly anything – to get those probability estimates. You can actually use <em>all</em> of those estimators to get the two probability estimates, if you want! More on that later.</p>
<p>The benefit of expanding your toolbox of potential estimators is that most estimators are built with prediction in mind, and thus yield very good probability estimates to initiate our TMLE algorithm. When our goal as statisticians is to calculate effects on an outcome attributable to an exposure, it’s easy to shy away from these orediction-focused types of estimators, because most of them do not have any statistical theory to allow us to calculate valid confidence intervals.</p>
<p><strong>The huge selling point of TMLE is that it allows you to utilize prediction-focused, often non-parametric, estimators, but still obtain valid confidence intervals on your final estimate of the exposure’s effect.</strong> In other methods, like IPTW, we can only obtain valid confidence intervals if we obtain our propensity score using pre-specified parametric models. For example, we fit a logistic regression for our exposure predicted by eight pre-specified baseline covariates.</p>
<p>This example logistic model to calculate the propensity score is not only placing a strong distributional assumption on our data, but it is limited in its ability to take in high-, or even medium-dimensional data. When we use estimators that are well equipped for very “wide” data and perform variable selection, we obtain better overall estimates for our exposure effect of interest.</p>
<p>There is another benefit to TMLE: it has very good bias-variance properties, and those properties are “robust,” or “resistant to” model mispecification, or having the wrong type of estimator and/or the wrong variables in your estimation of either the exposure or outcome. However, if you’re interested in these properities, you should really check out the references, because it’s time for an example!</p>
<p>The benefit of expanding your toolbox of potential estimators is that most estimators are built with prediction in mind, and are much better at prediction than the generalized linear models we often use to calculate exposure effects</p>
<ul>
<li>one of your models can be misspecified, and the estimate is still resistant to bias</li>
</ul>
<p>are non-parametric, meaning they don’t place strong assumptions on the underlying distribution of your data. They , which is often a problem in estimating effects of treatment</p>
<p>See, an issue comes up with IPTW estimation in that you can only obtain valid confidence intervals on your final estimate of the exposure effect if you used a pre-specified parametric model to obtain your propensity score estimate. An example of this would be saying, I think these 10 variables go into the probability of an individual’s exposure, and then fitting</p>
<p>TMLE uses the same estimates that are used in IPTW, but uses the idea that we don’t care what or how confounders help us predict exposure, or what or how outcome predicted by exposure occurs. We are good statisticians, and our analysis goal is to estimate the exposure effect, right? So we should use whatever models will help us obtain the estimates needed to get the probability of our outcome under the <em>this</em> exposure vs. <em>that</em> exposure.</p>
<p>By targeting the variable of exposure as our parameter of interest, we can adapt theory from Maximum Likelihood Estimation (a form of Minimum Loss Based Estimation, since MLE is a loss function)</p>
<p>and how they help us predict</p>
<p>there’s other nice properties of tmle, like it is resistant to misspecification of mdoels, but as a statistician who wants to stay up to date with the best methodology, the ability to combine non parametric machine-learning models to get exposure effects with valid confidence intervals is really the only reason I need to implement it.</p>
<p>Have I bored and/or confused you enough? Let’s look at an exmaple with code:</p>
<p>My one sentence reason for using TMLE: it allows you to use better regressions for predicting than parametric models</p>
<p>To understand how the various machine learning models are combining, you should look into a type of ensemble learning called stacking, or “superlearning.” I have a slideshow that you could look at here, but there are plenty of other resources online.</p>
<p>If you remember learning about an EM algorithm, it’s similar in that it’s an iterative process of updating an initial estimate until the algorithm converges on</p>
<p>Another way of using that probability estimate of exposure given confounders, or “propensity score” is to</p>
<p>TMLE allows you to</p>
<p>We cannot answer this with “regular” regression models like linear regression, because we assume the outcome is the average, or expectation, holding all other covariates constant.</p>
<p><sub>basically</sub></p>
<p>This is obviously not a super technical post, and it was not intended to be, but I hope that it may catch your interest to learn more about the complexities of TMLE and try it out in your next analysis. I hope to write a few similar posts on what to do if your outcomes are survival or longitudinal data. In the meantime, feedback or questions are welcome.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
