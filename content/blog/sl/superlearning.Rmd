What's everyone else doing for Coronavirus social distancing activities?! One of my main ones has been reading a statistics textbook called *Targeted Learning*. I am really enjoying reading it, but there are a lot of moving parts, so I constantly have to check my understanding.

The best way for me to figure out what I've learned is to write or draw everything out step-by-step. I tried this for Chapter 3 of *Targeted Learning*, which is all about a prediction algorithm called superlearning, or stacking. I consider myself a very visual learner, so I made a "visual guide" to explicitly show each step of superlearning. Besides making a nice decoration for my desk, I'm hoping it can help another visual learner or two understand superlearning a bit faster.

What is superlearning?

Superlearning is the process of ensembling many types of estimation/prediction algorims together to use
