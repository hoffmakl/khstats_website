<h2>First things first, learning causal inference is hard</h2>
<p>It’s no secret that causal inference, or the study of what <em>would</em> have happened if a certain variable in a system were manipulated, is a rapidly expanding field. I love to read new (and old!) papers in the causal inference literature because it helps me do better medical research as an applied biostatistician. However, for a long time my goal in reading almost any causal inference paper was simply “try not to get too lost.” It wasn’t the jargon that overwhelmed me (although that’s definitely a barrier for learning causal inference), but rather that I had no clear “big picture” view of causal inference. I was collecting a lot of small pieces of information, but I was missing how they all fit together.</p>
<p>In this post I want to share a strategy that really helped me improve my ability to read a new causal inference paper.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons the causal inference literature is difficult to just pick up and learn is because . Even within the field of statistics, there are some very distinct “lineages” of methodology (e.g. Robins, Pearl, and Rubin), which makes even the starting frameworks really hard to translate when you’re a beginner.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that causal inference is a rapidly developing field. If you’re tried to learn pieces of causal inference already (rightly so!) that it can be pretty difficult.</p>
<p>really easy point to miss when you’re first learning causal inference. It is the idea that you should always <strong>keep identification separate from estimation</strong> when you’re reading a new topic in causal inference.</p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions. Notably, Miguel Hernan and James Robins recently published <em>What If</em> book is written for a beginner audience.</p>

<li><p>How does this estimator <strong>compare</strong> to other estimators to estimate the same statistical estimand?</p></li>

<h2>Causal Estimand</h2>
<p><strong>Causal estimand:</strong> a quantity that exists in some hypothetical world where you can administer multiple interventions, or treatments, and then observe the outcome under all of those interventions.</p>
<p><em>Alternative names:</em> causal parameter, functional.</p>
<p><em>Examples:</em> Average Treatment Effect</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Causal inference has been in development by a <em>ton</em> of different fields (economics, epidemiology, computer science, statistics) and has just recently begun to explode.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a list of some estimands discussed in the causal inference literature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe the key to learning (and applying) causal inference is to always keep <strong>identification</strong> separate from <strong>estimation</strong>.
Now what does <em>that</em> mean!? Broadly, <strong>identification means figuring out whether you can write a causal estimand of interest in terms of data</strong> (i.e., in forms of expectations of random variables).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <strong>causal estimand</strong> is just some summary quantity that would be interesting to evaluate in the system you’re studying. A few common causal estimands are the Average Treatment Effect and the Conditional Average Treatment Effect. There are many, many more though, such as the Dose Response Curve, Causal Odds Ratio, Causal Risk Ratio, and Marginal Structural Model.</p>
<p>To determine whether you can identify your causal estimand of interest in your system of study and with the data you have, careful thought is required. It’s the stage of a problem when you, as a statistician, sit down and talk with subject matter experts about the precise question they’d like to answer. You may draw <em>Directed Acyclic Graphs</em> (DAGs) or <em>Single World Intervention Graphs</em> (SWIGs), or write out the <em>Non Parametric Structural Causal Equations</em> of the system.</p>
<p>These tools will help you evaluate some of the main requirements of causal inference: for the causal estimand of interest to be identified, you must satisfy causal assumptions of <em>positivity</em>, <em>exchangeability</em>, and <em>ignorability</em>, while still avoiding the usual pitfalls in statistics like <em>selection bias</em> and <em>unmeasured confounding</em>.</p>
<p>You’ll eventually determine whether the causal estimand is possible to write out in terms of your data. For example, if your goal is to identify the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), i.e. the mean difference in outcomes between the treated and untreated in a hypothetical world where everyone <em>could</em> get each treatment <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, your identification of the ATE, <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, may look like:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\theta = E_W[E[Y|A=1,W]-E[Y|A=0,W]]\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is a vector of confounding variables that affect both <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Once</p>
<p>Everything I’ve mentioned so far is part of the <strong>identification</strong> side of causal inference. I think of it as the non-data side, because we are not yet dealing with data when we think about the study design, causal estimand, and whether the causal conditions are reasonable to assume. You should never be thinking about <strong>estimation methods</strong> until you’ve determined whether your causal estimand can be identified.</p>
<p><img src="/img/causal_comic.jpg" /></p>
<p>Once you’ve <em>identified</em> your WHAT, or your estimand of interest, then you can start thinking about HOW you’re going to <em>estimate</em> that estimand. There are many statistical estimation methods to estimate the same causal effect of interest.</p>
<p>My favorite way to think about this is through a little graph like this. On the left, there are three causal estimands, or estimands of interest. On the top, we can see six different ways you might try to estimate any of these causal estimands of interest. Each of the estimation methods have pros and cons.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Odds ratio = E[Y]\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(Relative risk = E[Y]\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{ATE} = E[Y]\)</span></p>
