My primary collaboration is with pulmonologists and intensivists in WCM's [Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine](https://medicine.weill.cornell.edu/divisions-programs/pulmonary-critical-care-medicine). Our research covers chronic illnesses such as Interstitial Lung Disease and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, as well as acute-onset critical illnesses such as Sepsis, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, and in recent months, COVID-19.
  
I served as the Teaching Assistant for Data Science I in Fall 2019, Biostatistics II in Winter 2019, and 
Modern Methods for Causal Inference in Summer 2019 and 2020 and have contributed multiple talks to our [WCM Biostatistics Computing Club](https://wcm-computing-club.github.io/).
