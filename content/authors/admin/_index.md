I am a Research Biostatistician at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City who is passionate about meaningful, reproducible medical research. In addition to my research collaborations, I assist with multiple courses in WCM’s [Biostatistics and Data Science MS program](https://hpr.weill.cornell.edu/graduate-education-clinical-training/masters-track/biostatistics-data-science).

Prior to becoming a statistician, I cared for patients in the hospital as a nurse tech, played Division I softball and coached high schoolers, and wrote a [thesis](http://dspace.udmercy.edu:8080/bitstream/handle/10429/777/Hoffman_UDMHonorsThesis.pdf?sequence=1) on artists’ portrayal of mental illness.
